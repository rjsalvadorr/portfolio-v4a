## NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS

I've noticed some inconsistent/buggy/odd behaviour when dev'ing on windows:

1. Use Powershell/CMD when RUNNING the site locally! The dev process does not work on my terminal emulator on Windows 10. :(
1. Use a terminal emulator when BUILDING the site for deployment. I'm seeing buggy behaviour on build outputs when done on Powershell.
